Hello everyone! 🤟🏼

I'm Momo, a passionate WebDev student from Italy. 🧑🏻‍💻 🇮🇹

There you'll find all the public stuffs on which I've worked  on  my developing journey about languages, frameworks and libraries. 📚  

I'm currently trying to  learn Laravel with all its magic features and  facilities for backend stuffs.  🚀  

I'm also in love with JavaScript (trying to learn JS plain, started from jQuery).
